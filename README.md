# ILC

ILC stands for Integrated Lightinc Control and is a system capable of generating lighting effects with its dmx engine.

## How to compile:

Create a folder called build/ and enter it:

> /: mkdir build && cd build

Invoke cmake to generate all Makefiles:

> build/: cmake ..

Now the build files are localed in the build/ directory.
This means you can invoke Make to compile the project:

> build/: make all

The output should appear in the bin/ folder insice the build/ directory:

> build/bin/: ls -la

To execute from the build directory:

> build/: ./bin/ilc

ILC should now start. You can exit via CTRL+C (forcefully).
To terminate it correctly, use the SIGTERM (15) signal. This assumes you know the Process ID ([PID]) through e.g. ps, top or similar.

> /: kill -15 [PID]
